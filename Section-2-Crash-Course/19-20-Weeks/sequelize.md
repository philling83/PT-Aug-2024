## Writing SQL Using Javascript and Sequelize ORM!

## Sequelize has three major file types
- Models
- Migrations
- Seeders

---

## ORM (Object Relational Mapping / Mapper)
**Object Relational Mapping**: is a technique that allows programmers to work with data in a relational database (such as a SQL database) using an object-oriented approach.
- instances of an object in your code
which are mapped directly to rows of data in the database table.

**Mapper**: Library called Sequelize to work with your data directly using the JavaScript language, through a concept called Object Relational Mapping (ORM).
- Using JavaScript and OOP to write JavaScript logic, and manipulate our database, instead of SQL

## Database Model 

A 'model' for the data in our tables

JS Classes were the 'blueprints', and an instance was the 'building'

```js
class Dog {
  // this is the blueprint to make dogs
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.isGoodDog = true;
  }
}

const guardDog = new Dog('Cerberus', 1000); // an instance of the Dog class
```

Models are JS Classes as well! Every instance is a row in our table

```js
class Dog extends Model {
  static associate(models) {
    // how we create relationships between tables
  }
}

Dog.init(
  // this is basically the constructor
  {
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
    age: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    isGoodDog: {
      type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
      defaultValue: true,
    },
  }
);
```

Later we'll learn to create rows in our table using Sequelize syntax instead of saying `new Dog()`. (we will also learn how to create, read, update, delete data - CRUD)

For now, think of models as the blueprint or API that allows us to interact with the data / rows within our database.

## Migrations == Mutations ðŸ¦ 

Any change to our database schema, including creating it!
- **makes and keeps track of changes in our schema (schema = structure of our database w/ all tables and its relationships**: JS File that defines a specific change within our database schema (i.e. maybe a change in a table, etc.).

Sequelize automatically generates migration files based on your models

- This makes migrations act as a version-control system
- Any change you make can be logged and reverted


**Examples:**
- **`adding new table:`** if you are starting a **new project**, you would run a **migration to create a new database table**. 
- **`changing existing column:`** If you have an **existing project**, you might need to **run a migration to make a small change to a table, such as adding a new column**.

## Plant Data With Seeds ðŸŒ±
Think of it as **dummy data**. Seeder files are used to populate the database tables with sample data, or update the sample data as migrations are run.
